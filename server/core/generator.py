"""LLM-driven prompt assembly for image generation.

Replaces v1's 4 hardcoded template functions with a single LLM composition
call. Elements are gathered from the library via archetype matching, then
fed to the LLM with a style instruction. The LLM composes natural-language
prompts for any genre — landscape, portrait, automotive, etc.

Supports a "Native" style that generates prompts matching the source
material's detected artistic medium (e.g., watercolor, line art, 3D render)
instead of defaulting to photography language.

Negative prompts use a hybrid approach:
  - LLM generates style-appropriate negatives
  - Template base provides safety-net terms
  - Dynamic anti-affinity from archetype element types

        "this medium."

        "connection. The result should feel intimate and subject-driven."
