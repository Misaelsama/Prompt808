# Prompt808

**Vision-LLM prompt generation for ComfyUI** — analyze your images, build a personal style library, and generate prompts that match your aesthetic.

![Prompt808 sidebar](docs/screenshots/hero.png)

## What It Does

Prompt808 learns from your images. Drop in reference photos or artwork, and a vision model extracts the elements that define each image — lighting, composition, palette, mood, and more. Those elements become a growing library that Prompt808 draws from to generate prompts tailored to your visual style.

## Features

- **Learns from your images** — A vision model analyzes each upload and extracts structured scene elements into a growing library
- **Multiple prompt styles** — Cinematic, Fine Art, Fashion, Documentary, Portrait, Street, Architectural, and more
- **LLM-powered composition** — Natural-language prompts with six enrichment levels from faithful reproduction to full creative freedom
- **Multi-library support** — Maintain separate libraries for different projects or genres, each fully isolated
- **ComfyUI native** — Sidebar panel for interactive use, plus a workflow node for automated generation
- **Medium-aware** — Automatically detects whether an image is a photograph, painting, illustration, or 3D render, and adjusts extraction accordingly

## Requirements

- ComfyUI (latest recommended)
- Python 3.10+
- CUDA GPU (8+ GB VRAM for analysis, 1+ GB for generation)

## Installation

Install as a ComfyUI custom node:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone <repo-url> Prompt808
pip install -r Prompt808/requirements.txt
```

Restart ComfyUI after installation.

## Quickstart

### 1. Create a library

Click the camera icon in ComfyUI's sidebar to open the Prompt808 panel. On first launch, click **"+ Create Your First Library"** and give it a name (e.g. "Portraits", "Landscapes"). The first library is automatically activated.

### 2. Analyze images

Navigate to the **Analyze** tab. Add images by:

- Drag and drop from your file manager
- Click to browse
- Drag images from a browser window
- Paste from clipboard (Ctrl+V)

Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP, BMP, TIFF, HEIC. Batch upload is supported — each image is processed sequentially with live progress.

### 3. Browse your library

The **Library** tab shows all extracted elements. Filter by category, edit descriptions and tags, or delete elements.

The **Photos** tab displays thumbnails of all analyzed images. Click a photo to see its extracted elements, or delete a photo to remove it with all associated data.

### 4. Generate prompts

On the **Generate** tab, select a style, mood, and archetype, then click Generate. Copy the prompt and negative prompt to your clipboard, or wire them directly from the node.

### 5. Use the node

Add a **Prompt808 Generate** node to your ComfyUI workflow. Core generation settings are exposed as node dropdown inputs; temperature, max_tokens, and keep_model_loaded are read from the sidebar settings.

![Node in workflow](docs/screenshots/node-workflow.png)

Generation results from the node are automatically pushed to the sidebar's Generate tab via WebSocket.

### 6. Multi-library workflow

Use the library dropdown at the top of the sidebar or in the node to:

- **Switch** between libraries (each has its own elements, archetypes, style profiles, and dedup caches)
- **Create** new libraries for different projects or genres
- **Rename** or **delete** libraries

Libraries are fully isolated — the same image can exist in different libraries with different extracted elements.

## Models

### Vision Models (analysis)

| Model                            | VRAM    | Notes                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct             | ~12 GB  | Default, good quality                           |
| Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-abliterated | ~12 GB  | Abliterated variant for unrestricted extraction |
| Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-FP8         | ~7.5 GB | Pre-quantized, good for 8 GB cards              |
| Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking             | ~12 GB  | Chain-of-thought reasoning                      |
| Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking-FP8         | ~7.5 GB | Thinking model, pre-quantized                   |
| Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct            | ~28 GB  | Higher quality extraction                       |
| Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct-FP8        | ~24 GB  | Pre-quantized 32B                               |
| Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking            | ~28 GB  | Best quality, chain-of-thought                  |
| Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking-FP8        | ~24 GB  | Thinking 32B, pre-quantized                     |

Vision models with non-standard tensor dimensions automatically fall back from FP8 to FP16 if block quantization is incompatible.
